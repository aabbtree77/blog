["The achievement of abstraction is to get up to the next higher level where you do not have to be concerned with locks and queues. As soon as you have a thousand cores on your chip, the world has changed. The programmer now knows nothing about the environment, what the load is, how many cores there are, what program priority is, he knows nothing."](https://youtu.be/7erJ1DV_Tlo?t=1854)

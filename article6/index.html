<p><a href="https://physicsteacher.blog/category/eratosthenes-size-of-the-earth-radius-of-the-earth-first-measurement/">Eratosthenes (240 BC).</a> Measuring the radius of Earth. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said the visitor, &ldquo;at noon on this day, in my home town there are no shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://prideout.net/blog/romer/">Ole Rømer (1671).</a> Io eclipse times measured on Earth six months apart. It turns out that the value is changing, and the experiment reveals something else.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arago_spot">Arago White Spot (1818).</a> Shadows are not what they seem. The disk had to be nearly perfect (3% roughness would make the spot vanish). Similarly, one can obtain a black spot when an obstacle is replaced with an aperture.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8qVLMHW5cbY?t=783">P.N. Lebedev (1899).</a> Light exerts a mechanical pressure. Pavlo Victor shows the radiometric effect which P.N. Lebedev had to suppress along with the thermal convection.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound%E2%80%93Rebka_experiment">The Pound–Rebka experiment (1959)</a> measured a minuscule change of light&rsquo;s frequency due to gravity, confirming GR.</p>

# Classical Light

Physics gets [tiresome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanical_scattering_of_photon_and_nucleus) with QM and QFT. Mathematics does a bad job compressing it. However, we have very few key experiments. This is the way.

[Eratosthenes (240 BC).](https://physicsteacher.blog/category/eratosthenes-size-of-the-earth-radius-of-the-earth-first-measurement/) Measuring the radius of Earth. "You know," said the visitor, "at noon on this day, in my home town there are no shadows."

[Ole Rømer (1671).](https://prideout.net/blog/romer/) Io eclipse times measured on Earth six months apart. It turns out that the value is changing, and the experiment reveals something else.

[Arago White Spot (1818).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arago_spot) Shadows are not what they seem. The disk had to be nearly perfect (3% roughness would make the spot vanish). Similarly, one can obtain a black spot when an obstacle is replaced with an aperture.

[P.N. Lebedev (1899).](https://youtu.be/8qVLMHW5cbY?t=783) Light exerts a mechanical pressure. Pavlo Victor shows the radiometric effect which P.N. Lebedev had to suppress along with the thermal convection.

[The Pound–Rebka experiment (1959)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound%E2%80%93Rebka_experiment) measured a minuscule change of light's frequency due to gravity, confirming GR.

More of this magic: [Valerian Gervids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsLqQC52NTY), [Walter Lewin](https://youtu.be/ESAPg7w3wm8?t=2872), [Veritasium](https://youtu.be/oI_X2cMHNe0?t=1134), [QuinnPhys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brPr1g-i2Tk), [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRTczANuIs)...

[Daniele Dallacasa (Radioastronomy)](http://www.ira.inaf.it/%7Eddallaca/L01_HDMHD.pdf): "Lectures will provide all (most of) the tools to understand what we observe in the Universe (i.e. radiation)".

Science &#8801; attention to detail. Classical light &#8801; classical electromagnetism.

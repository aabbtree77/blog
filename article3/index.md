# Lie Groups

There is a theorem in Lie theory which states: An invariant multivariate function $f$ satisfies the necessary and sufficient condition $Gf=0$, where $G$ is the Lie group generator, see e.g. &#167; 68, page 82 in [J. E. Campbell (1903)](https://archive.org/details/introductorytrea00campuoft). Abraham Cohen (1911) and Leonard Eugene Dickson (1924) are also readable (Bourbaki-free). [Pavel Zhilin (2003)](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%96%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD,_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87_(%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA))  extends the theorem to the functions of multiple transforming objects of different types (vectors and matrices): [(2003 Ru)](http://teormeh.net/Zhilin_New/pdf/Zhilin_Invariant_rus.pdf), [(2005 Eng)](http://teormeh.net/Zhilin_New/pdf/Zhilin_Invariant_eng.pdf).

The invariance requirement is posed as a functional equation. It is solved with a trick which gives a single weight to all the group parameters (I would have differentiated w.r.t. all the parameters independently, only to become lost).

Paradoxically, theoretical mechanics is the only domain where I have found a method to construct invariant functions. A brilliant work which distills Lie theory into a coherent solution chain.

# Programming Links

A few links related to programming philosophy, compilers, distributed systems, design.

### Philosophy

- [Carl Hewitt](https://youtu.be/7erJ1DV_Tlo?t=2368): "We do not know much and some of it is wrong."

- [Rob Pike](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html): "Less is exponentially more."

### Compilers

- [Ark](https://github.com/ark-lang/ark): A static non-GC language written in Go and LLVM: FFI to C, OpenGL demo.

- [mini-js](https://github.com/maierfelix/mini-js/tree/master): "Minimal self-hosted JavaScript compiler in 1k lines of code."

- [Monkey](https://github.com/search?q=monkey+interpreter): A minimal Js-like language interpreter and bytecode VM implemented with a recursive descent parser, in Go. Lots of following!

- [Mugo](https://benhoyt.com/writings/mugo/): A subset of Go compiled to the x86-64 assembly, in Go.

### Distributed Systems

- [Sameer Ajmani](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/go/simulating-a-real-world-system-in-go): Simulating a Real-World System in Go.

### Design

- [Dynomight](https://dynomight.net/lists/): How I learned to stop worrying and structure all writing as a list.

- [Sajid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyomWr_C_jA): The Easy Way to Design Top Tier Websites.

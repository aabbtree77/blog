A few ideas/resources that I have missed in my school/university years.

### Philosophy

- [Carl Hewitt](https://youtu.be/7erJ1DV_Tlo?t=2368): "We do not know much and some of it is wrong."

- [Rob Pike](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html): "Less is exponentially more."

- [Guido van Rossum](https://www.cwi.nl/en/stories/interview-guido-van-rossum-201cid-rather-write-code-than-papers201d/): "I'd rather write code than papers."

### Distributed Systems

- [Rob Pike](https://go.dev/blog/waza-talk): The problem of moving obsolete manuals to the incinerator. Manuals, gophers, carts, and the incinerator. Load, move, unload, return. Another good example for concurrency/parallelism is a chess simul between many amateurs and a few GMs or just a single GM.

- [Sameer Ajmani](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/go/simulating-a-real-world-system-in-go): "Simulating a Real-World System in Go."  

### Compilers

- [Ark (2015):](https://github.com/ark-lang/ark) A static non-GC language written with Go and LLVM: FFI to C, OpenGL demo.

- [mini-js (2017):](https://github.com/maierfelix/mini-js/tree/master) "Minimal self-hosted JavaScript compiler in 1k lines of code."

- [Monkey (2018):](https://github.com/search?q=monkey+interpreter) A minimal Js-like language implemented with a recursive descent parser, in Go. Lots of following!

- [Mugo (2021):](https://benhoyt.com/writings/mugo/) A subset of Go compiled to the x86-64 assembly, in Go.

### Design

- How to create a presentation in draw.io [(2022)](https://community.tmpdir.org/t/how-to-create-a-presentation-in-draw-io/488).

- How I learned to stop worrying and structure all writing as a list [(2023)](https://dynomight.net/lists/).

- The Easy Way to Design Top Tier Websites [(2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyomWr_C_jA).

### Complex Projects that Make Sense (Sort of)

- [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/). Send a message from any remote computer to any remote computer without any paid 3rd party services. It takes 70 KLOC of Go, no 100% message delivery guarantee, very slow, but it works and is enough to build entire new worlds like Ethereum. 
Lots of digital wallets, crypto currencies with entire platforms and new sorts of databases, but we still do not have e-voting. 

- [AnKi 3D engine](https://github.com/godlikepanos/anki-3d-engine). We definitely need something better than Unity/Unreal/Godot or say Blender's GPL internals, in 3D. This engine is a rare example of massive C++ and Vulkan code with a clean compilation. One could study and document this code, build examples, the 3D editor, community. 

Something inside me resists going deeper into these code bases. So much complexity.

### Algebra

- [The box method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_method_multiplication) advanced to solve a quadratic equation in ["Al-Jabr" by Al-Khwarizmi, the 9th century](https://youtu.be/z5-EEkgnvAY?t=1077). I missed these two concepts entirely in my school years. A simple way to multiply two numbers (we memorized some silly mnemonic rules instead because they were "faster"), and the original method of Al-Khwarizmi, emphasized by Торвальд Олафсен. When algebra was still geometry and practical problems, not Haskell.

- [Dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis). What is the temperature at the center of the Sun, given the star's mass, radius, the gravitational constant, and assuming it is a ball of hydrogen? See B.N. Ivanov. Laws of Physics (1986, in Russian), page 286.

### "Human Stack Overflow"

- Ettore Majorana, Alexander Grothendieck, Bobby Fischer, Linn Berggren...

- Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson...

- Sergei Mavrodi.

- Stefan Zweig and Lotte Altmann, Jean Seberg and Romain Gary.

- [Sadhu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKpulDFGrhU).

# Parser/Compiler Links

There is a lot of heavy compiler theory that people study for years. I will add a few practical links here to get one started.

[Ark (2015):](https://github.com/ark-lang/ark) A static non-GC language written with Go and LLVM: FFI to C, OpenGL demo.

[mini-js (2017):](https://github.com/maierfelix/mini-js/tree/master) "Minimal self-hosted JavaScript compiler in 1k lines of code."

[Monkey (2018):](https://github.com/search?q=monkey+interpreter) A minimal Js-like language implemented with a recursive descent parser, in Go. Lots of following!

[Mugo (2021):](https://benhoyt.com/writings/mugo/) A subset of Go compiled to the x86-64 assembly, in Go.

[The Art of Code (2022).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwLQMuTspxE) One of the most beautiful and entertaining presentations about computing models and programming languages.

[mov (2013)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61048788/why-is-mov-turing-complete) and [movfuscator (2015).](https://github.com/Battelle/movfuscator) One of the remarkable brain twisters.

# My Awesome List

A few inspiring resources related to programming.

### Philosophy

- [Carl Hewitt](https://youtu.be/7erJ1DV_Tlo?t=2368): "We do not know much and some of it is wrong."

- [Rob Pike](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html): "Less is exponentially more."

### Compilers

- [Ark (2015):](https://github.com/ark-lang/ark) A static non-GC language written in Go and LLVM: FFI to C, OpenGL demo.

- [mini-js (2017):](https://github.com/maierfelix/mini-js/tree/master) "Minimal self-hosted JavaScript compiler in 1k lines of code."

- [Monkey (2018):](https://github.com/search?q=monkey+interpreter) A minimal Js-like language implemented with a recursive descent parser, in Go. Lots of following!

- [Mugo (2021):](https://benhoyt.com/writings/mugo/) A subset of Go compiled to the x86-64 assembly, in Go.

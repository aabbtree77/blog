# Programming Links

A few ideas/resources that I have missed in my school/university years.

### Computing/Philosophy

- [Carl Hewitt](https://youtu.be/7erJ1DV_Tlo?t=2368): "The fundamental situation is that we do not know much and some of it is wrong."

- [Joe Armstrong](https://youtu.be/TTM_b7EJg5E?t=318): "Remember, in a distributed system you never know how things are, you know how they were the last time they told you."

- Rob Pike: ["Less is exponentially more"](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html), ["Simplicity is complicated"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM).

- [Guido van Rossum](https://www.cwi.nl/en/stories/interview-guido-van-rossum-201cid-rather-write-code-than-papers201d/): "I'd rather write code than papers."

- Stephen Dolan: ["mov is Turing-complete"](https://drwho.virtadpt.net/files/mov.pdf). [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61048788/why-is-mov-turing-complete), [movfuscator](https://github.com/Battelle/movfuscator).

- [Dylan Beattie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwLQMuTspxE): "Midnight takes your heart and your soul."

- [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat): "Does anyone know, in Javascript, what array plus array is?"

- [Daniel H. H. Ingalls](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html): "An operating system is a collection of things that don’t fit into a language. There shouldn’t be one."

### Compilers

- [Ark (2015):](https://github.com/ark-lang/ark) A static non-GC language written with Go and LLVM: FFI to C, OpenGL demo.

- [mini-js (2017):](https://github.com/maierfelix/mini-js/tree/master) "Minimal self-hosted JavaScript compiler in 1k lines of code."

- [Monkey (2018):](https://github.com/search?q=monkey+interpreter) A minimal Js-like language implemented with a recursive descent parser, in Go. Lots of following!

- [Mugo (2021):](https://benhoyt.com/writings/mugo/) A subset of Go compiled to the x86-64 assembly, in Go.

### Design

- How to create a presentation in draw.io [(2022)](https://community.tmpdir.org/t/how-to-create-a-presentation-in-draw-io/488).

- How I learned to stop worrying and structure all writing as a list [(2023)](https://dynomight.net/lists/).

- The Easy Way to Design Top Tier Websites [(2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyomWr_C_jA).

### Underrated Software

- Ubuntu 22.04 desktop OS. Starts out in 2004, matures around 2020: NVIDIA drivers out of the box, GNOME 40 and Wayland, dxvk (1.10.3) pushes the PC games to [another level](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3789).

    Minor weaknesses: deb vs snap, Flutter in 24.04, remote desktop connections, wine does not support ms-store and xbox win libs (Forza Horizon...), no TomTom, Unreal, CAD, WhatsApp, Messenger, but Viber runs natively. Fragile "sudo apt upgrade", buggy rushed releases.

- [app.diagrams.net (draw.io)](https://drawio-app.com/blog/building-presentations-team-members-will-%F0%9F%A7%A1/) to make diagrams and [presentations](https://community.tmpdir.org/t/how-to-create-a-presentation-in-draw-io/488).

- golibp2p. The ability to send a message from code to code, for free. See my [IoT](https://github.com/aabbtree77/esp32-vpn) project for some uses and links.

- [F#](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/). The best static GC language that nobody uses. Unlucky with the platform.

- Nim: The best static non-GC language that nobody uses. It lacks sum types and is a big mess when it comes to pointers and compile time, just like anything else in this space. However, it gets the basics right and becomes exceptionally productive when most of its advanced features are simply not used.

- [AnKi 3D engine](https://github.com/godlikepanos/anki-3d-engine). More than a million lines of C++ and Vulkan compile cleanly on Ubuntu.

- Chess software: [Fruit](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Fabien_Letouzey#Fruit), [lichess.org](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila), [lc0](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0), [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish), [TCEC](https://github.com/TCEC-Chess), [CounterGo](https://github.com/ChizhovVadim/CounterGo), [Arena Chess GUI](http://www.playwitharena.de/#Linux).

- [Spintires (2014-2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spintires), [Inside (2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_(video_game)) run via wine. Let's hope that the 2024 remake of [Until Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Until_Dawn) will work on Ubuntu too.

### Algebra

- Inverse of [the box method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_method_multiplication) discovered in ["Al-Jabr" by Al-Khwarizmi, the 9th century](https://youtu.be/z5-EEkgnvAY?t=1077).

- [Dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis). What is the temperature at the center of the Sun, given the star's mass, radius, the gravitational constant, and assuming it is a ball of hydrogen? See B.N. Ivanov. Laws of Physics (1986, in Russian), page 286.

- Grid out of symbols. Given $H=(X^2+P^2)/2$, $[X,P] = ih\nu I$, and assuming that $e$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, $e-h\nu$ is also an eigenvalue, see V. Rojansky, Introductory QM, Chapter 11 (1938).

### "Human Stack Overflow"

- Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson...

- Sergei Mavrodi, Satoshi Nakamoto.

- Stefan Zweig and Lotte Altmann, Jean Seberg and Romain Gary.

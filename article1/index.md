A few ideas/resources that I have missed in my school/university years.

### Computing/Philosophy

- Carl Hewitt: ["The fundamental situation is that we do not know much and some of it is wrong"](https://youtu.be/7erJ1DV_Tlo?t=2368).

- Joe Armstrong: ["Remember, in a distributed system you never know how things are, you know how they were the last time they told you"](https://youtu.be/TTM_b7EJg5E?t=318).

- Rob Pike: ["Less is exponentially more"](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html), ["Simplicity is complicated"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM).

- Guido van Rossum: ["I'd rather write code than papers."](https://www.cwi.nl/en/stories/interview-guido-van-rossum-201cid-rather-write-code-than-papers201d/)

- Stephen Dolan: ["mov is Turing-complete"](https://drwho.virtadpt.net/files/mov.pdf). [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61048788/why-is-mov-turing-complete), [movfuscator](https://github.com/Battelle/movfuscator).

- Dylan Beattie: ["Midnight takes your heart and your soul."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwLQMuTspxE)

- Gary Bernhardt: ["Does anyone know, in Javascript, what array plus array is?"](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)

### Compilers

- [Ark (2015):](https://github.com/ark-lang/ark) A static non-GC language written with Go and LLVM: FFI to C, OpenGL demo.

- [mini-js (2017):](https://github.com/maierfelix/mini-js/tree/master) "Minimal self-hosted JavaScript compiler in 1k lines of code."

- [Monkey (2018):](https://github.com/search?q=monkey+interpreter) A minimal Js-like language implemented with a recursive descent parser, in Go. Lots of following!

- [Mugo (2021):](https://benhoyt.com/writings/mugo/) A subset of Go compiled to the x86-64 assembly, in Go.

### Design

- [How I learned to stop worrying and structure all writing as a list (2023).](https://dynomight.net/lists/)

- [The Easy Way to Design Top Tier Websites (2024).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyomWr_C_jA)

### Impressive Software Projects

- Ubuntu 22.04 desktop OS. Starts out in 2004, matures around 2020: NVIDIA drivers out of the box, GNOME 40 and Wayland finally settled, dxvk (1.10.3) pushes the ability to play Windows games to [another level](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3789).

    Minor weaknesses: deb vs snap, Flutter in 24.04, remote desktop connections, the games which rely on ms-store and xbox win libs (Forza Horizon...), TomTom, Unreal, CAD, never run "sudo apt upgrade", do not install a freshly released Ubuntu unless you want to be an unpaid beta tester. 
    
    Have a dual HD/SSD drive setup where most of your data will reside on a slow HD drive and the system on a faster SSD, with an Ubuntu USB stick nearby to reinstall the whole thing.

- Chromium/Chrome, Viber, Blender. They run natively on Ubuntu.

- [Spintires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spintires) run via wine.

- [app.diagrams.net (draw.io)](https://drawio-app.com/blog/building-presentations-team-members-will-%F0%9F%A7%A1/) to draw diagrams and make [presentations](https://community.tmpdir.org/t/how-to-create-a-presentation-in-draw-io/488).

- golibp2p. See my [IoT](https://github.com/aabbtree77/esp32-vpn) project for some uses and links.

- [F#](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/). The best static GC language that nobody uses. Other solid efforts by M$: VS Code, TypeScript.

- Nim: The best static non-GC language that nobody uses.

- avr-gcc for [the AVR microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers).

- Python, conda, matplotlib, pytorch.

- TypeScript and React for GUIs. Still lacking automated layout software and a decent full stack framework.

- [AnKi 3D engine](https://github.com/godlikepanos/anki-3d-engine). The code is virtually one-man army, more than a million lines of C++ and Vulkan that compile cleanly on Ubuntu!

- [Fruit](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Fabien_Letouzey#Fruit), [lichess.org](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila), [lc0](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0), [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish), [TCEC](https://github.com/TCEC-Chess).

### Puzzles

- [The box method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_method_multiplication) and its "inverse" discovered in ["Al-Jabr" by Al-Khwarizmi, the 9th century](https://youtu.be/z5-EEkgnvAY?t=1077).

- [Dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis). What is the temperature at the center of the Sun, given the starâ€™s mass, radius, the gravitational constant
  , and assuming it is a ball of hydrogen? The answer is 20 million kelvins. See e.g. B.N. Ivanov. Laws of Physics (1986, in Russian), page 286. This is also roughly the temperature of the entire universe around [100 - 1000 seconds after the Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe), when there are no atoms and stars yet.
